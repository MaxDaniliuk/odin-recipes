    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Medjool dates are the sweetening secret to these nutty, thick smoothies.</p>
      <p>A smoothie should be at least three things: filling, nutritious, and easy. This smoothie has all three of these crucial elements, plus the bonus of tasting like youâ€™re eating subtly sweet ice cream for breakfast. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 banana, sliced, frozen</li>
        <li>2 pitted Medjool dates</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons almond butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup oat milk, plus more as needed</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><p>Place banana, dates, almond butter, and oat milk in a blender and blend until smooth. Add more oat milk as needed, a splash at a time, until smoothie thins out to the desired consistency. Pour smoothie into a glass and serve immediately.</p></li>
      </ol>
