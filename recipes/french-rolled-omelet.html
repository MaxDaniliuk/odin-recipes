        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh herbs, such as chives, tarragon, and flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol id="dish">
        <li><p>Crack eggs into a bowl, add herbs, and season lightly with salt and pepper. Using wooden chopsticks, beat until well blended and ingredients are incorporated.</p></li>
        <li><p>Heat an 8-inch nonstick or seasoned carbon steel pan over high. Add butter, and cook until foamy but not browned, tipping pan to coat bottom evenly with melted butter.</p></li>
        <li><p>Pour eggs into pan; immediately swirl pan clockwise while stirring eggs vigorously counterclockwise with chopsticks to keep curds small and creamy.</p></li>
        <li><p>When a soft scramble forms, stop stirring eggs. Drag chopsticks around outside edge of omelet to turn wispy edges into scrambled eggs.</p></li>
